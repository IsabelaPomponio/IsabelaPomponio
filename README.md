# Hi there, I am Bebela

## About me:ðŸ™ƒ

I am a Systems development student at Etec in TaboÃ£o da Serra.
Still a beginner in the area, I try to understand more about the programming community.

I love drawing and painting as much as learning new things.

In addition to developing, I study electronics and know how to work with Arduinos.
